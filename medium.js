// MEDIUM: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. 
//(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
//You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
//You may assume no duplicate exists in the array. //

let num2 = [3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2];
